> Eggs break when dropped from great enough height. Specifically, there must be a floor f in any sufficiently tall building such that an egg dropped from the fth floor breaks, but one dropped from the (f − 1)st floor will not. If the egg always breaks, then f = 1. If the egg never breaks, then f = n + 1.
>
>You seek to find the critical floor f using an n-story building. The only operation you can perform is to drop an egg off some floor and see what happens. You start out with k eggs, and seek to drop eggs as few times as possible. Broken eggs cannot be reused. Let E(k,n) be the minimum number of egg droppings that will always suffice.
>
> - (a) Show that E(1, n) = n.
> - (b) Show that E(k, n) = Θ(n1/k ).
> - (c) Find a recurrence for E(k, n).
> - What is the running time of the dynamic program to find E(k, n)?
